# ModelMakR 

> This respository is no longer maintained and should be treated as __⛔️ DEPRECATED ⛔️__. I am currently in the process of rolling its functionality into [`urbanplanr`](https://github.com/ographiesresearch/urbanplanr). [Follow that migration here](https://github.com/ographiesresearch/urbanplanr/issues/11).

Built to automate 3D modeling tasks, including support for lasercut-ready files.
